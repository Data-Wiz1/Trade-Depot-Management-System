# Trade-Depot-Management-System

## Overview

This project is a part of the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course. It includes a C++ program that interacts with several CSV files to manage data. The main components of the project are:

- C++ source and header files
- CSV data files

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

- **balance.csv**: This file contains balance-related data.
- **data.csv**: This file contains general data used by the program.
- **file.cpp**: The main C++ source file containing the program logic.
- **login.h**: Header file for login functionalities.
- **orders.csv**: This file contains order-related data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the C++ program, you need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- A terminal or command prompt to execute the program
- CSV data files (`balance.csv`, `data.csv`, `orders.csv`)

### Compilation

If you need to recompile the program, use the following command in the terminal:

```sh
g++ -o file file.cpp
```

This command will generate a new executable named file.exe.

### Running the program

After compilation, you can run the program using:


```sh
./file.exe
```

## Usage

- Ensure all CSV files are in the same directory as the executable.
- Run the executable to start the program.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the program.
